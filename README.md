# Progress

- [x] core emulation of 6502, passes [Klaus' test suite](https://github.com/Klaus2m5/6502_65C02_functional_tests)
- [ ] functional emulator
  - [x] loading binary/text files
  - [x] base emulator implementation (the console with a screen and keypad)
  - [x] interactive memory monitor
  - [ ] step debugger
  - [ ] code editor
  - [ ] in memory virtual file system for the wasm target
- [ ] custom assembler
- [ ] custom programming language

There is a simple PoC deployed at [seg6.github.io/byte](https://seg6.github.io/byte/), running [demo.s](byte_emu/assets/demo.s).
